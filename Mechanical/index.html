          <p>
			Our chassis is designed to withstand 5g loads from all directions, meaning – in other
				words – we can crash and be completely fine! Everything about our car must be
				designed so that it is completely street legal, but at the same time remains lightweight
				and aerodynamic.

          <p>
			Preliminary tests of our aero body put our drag force at under 100 N for a speed of 65 mph. 
			  We still have some optimization to do on our aero body, but with its current design, we will be able to sustainably 
			  maintain highway speeds through the duration of the competition.

          <p>
			Our entire car, with all components and driver included, weighs in at around 500 pounds. 
			  With our lightweight body and aerodynamic shape, we will be able to drive halfway across the country 
			  on only the power of the sun.
