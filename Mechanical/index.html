		 <h2 class="my-4 bluetextcolor">Chassis</h2>
		  <p>Our chassis is designed to withstand 5g loads from all directions, meaning – in other
				words – we can crash and be completely fine! Everything about our car must be
				designed so that it is completely street legal, but at the same time remains lightweight
				and aerodynamic.

		  <p>Preliminary tests of our aero body put our drag force at around 100 N for a speed of 65
				mph. We still have significant optimization to do on our aero body, but with its current
				design, we would be able to sustain speeds of over 30 mph without ever engaging our battery pack.

		  <p>Our entire car, with all components and driver included, weighs in at well under 1000
			pounds. With our lightweight body and aerodynamic shape, we will be able to drive
			halfway across the country on only the power of the sun.
