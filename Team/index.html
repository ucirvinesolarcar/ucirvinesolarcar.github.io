										<p class="imgDescription">I joined solar car because I am extremely passionate about renewable energy, and being part of this team allows me t
										he opportunity to explore the use of solar energy in a car that needs to be designed for maximum efficiency and safety. 
										As part of UC Irvine’s founding team, my ultimate goal is build the foundation for many future teams of UC Irvine solar racers. 
										Since we are our schools first solar car team, we will stumble and fall a lot while designing and constructing our car, 
										but from our failures we will learn a lot and be much better engineers than when we started.</p>

										<p class="imgDescription">I joined solar car because I really wanted to be part of a project that promotes the use of alternative energy. The car is powered by the sun! How could that not be exciting? I hope to gain more experience in working with a team and learning everything that goes behind making a solar car. This project also stemmed from the organization I founded, Engineers for a Sustainable World at UCI, and I hope to encourage other students to start their own engineering projects and make an impact on the community. </p>
