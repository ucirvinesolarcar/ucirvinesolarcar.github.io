<b>Week 1 Update</b>

We are starting off strong with our first ever UCI Solar Car Team! We have completed our first week of meetings for the new quarter! We’ve gotten a lot done so far. We had our first interview for the SDP Fund from Boeing to see how much funding we can get. We are trying to decide on a driver, who is hopefully in the 5’2” - 5’8” range. As we design and build from scratch, join us on our awesome journey from start to finish!!!!! :~)




<i>Mechanical Team (Aero, Suspension, Chassis)</i>

Chassis team have a rough model ready. They modeled the dimensions of the chassis around a mock dummy. They plan to stress test and revise the framework according to the driver’s dimensions, after a driver is chosen.
Suspension has almost finished the assembly of the suspension and chassis. They’re working on steering. They plan to model brakes and enhance the dimensions. 
Aero has the basic body and canopy of the car after much research on the different shapes and fasteners. Now they’re researching how to make molds and designing the lower body.
