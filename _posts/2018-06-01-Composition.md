<b>Update No.4</b>

It has been almost a year since our last blog post, but that’s all going to change very soon! To start off the third quarter of the second year of our team’s creation, this post is going to go over what our fantastic Composition team lead by Bilal is doing.

<i>Compositional</i>

The Compositional team has done a lot this entire quarter, working very hard to get the Solar Car done and ready. The team’s goals included creating a quarter-scale model of the full body, manufacture the dashboard and steering wheel. Before all of that the team helped out their friends over in the electrical team by making a batter box of fiberglass and foam sandwich, however that didn’t work so well, so they scrapped that piece of work due to incorrect compression. The team ended up getting the quarter size mold to the lab as we reached midway through the quarter. The 3D printer ended up breaking down half way through the quarter so the team just started and finished designs for things such as the dashboard and the battery box. The team ended mid-way through the quarter with UROP in hopes of getting more money for the team. They finished up the first layer of fiberglass layup for the quarter sized mold and then started the solar cell encapsulation process (using EVA film). As the quarter comes to a finish the team scotch weld 420 adhesive for attachment points between chassis to shell while picking up the fiberglass material to work on top and bottom shells. The composition team has been hard at work to really get the racecar made and ready for testing. Great job from the composition team and below are photos of their work!
