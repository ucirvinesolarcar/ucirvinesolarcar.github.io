<b>Update #3</b>

The first official quarter of the UCI Solar Car Team has ended. We have accomplished a lot in this quarter and will 
continue to work hard on our car through the summer.
 
<i>Mechanical</i>
As for the Mechanical team, the Chassis team built their mock chassis by connecting PVC pipes in order to better visualize 
the dimensions of the chassis. After visualizing the mock chassis, they decided to reduce the ride height, decrease the length, 
and taper the front to keep within the regulations and reduce the weight of the chassis. They have done a lot of stress testing 
with the new chassis. In the summer, they will build the actual chassis.


<i>Electrical</i>
The Electrical Team has completed their solar array and is beginning to test their entire electrical system. They finalized 
and purchased the batteries for the car. They have also built the entire frame for the solar array and assembled the components. 
The assembly includes connecting the solar array to the charge controller to the battery pack to the inverter to the motors.
